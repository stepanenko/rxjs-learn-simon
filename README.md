The Rx in RxJS is ReactiveX. This is an API for asynchronous programming using observables. It's tremendously powerful and it offers a new way of structuring applications.

The JS of course is JavaScript. RxJS is the JavaScript implementation of ReactiveX, and that's what this RxJS tutorial is all about. You're going to learn how to harness the power of ReactiveX while using JavaScript.

We're going to start out by setting up a quick development environment from scratch, and then we'll work our way through all of the major ReactiveX topics in an example-based environment.

My goal in this course is to help absolute beginners to ReactiveX and RxJS gain a solid understanding of the following:

- Streams
- Observables & Observers
- Subscriptions
- Subjects
- Operators
