The Rx in RxJS is ReactiveX. This is an API for asynchronous programming using observables. <br>
It's tremendously powerful and it offers a new way of structuring applications.

The JS of course is JavaScript. RxJS is the JavaScript implementation of ReactiveX, <br>
and that's what this RxJS tutorial is all about. You're going to learn how to harness <br>
the power of ReactiveX while using JavaScript.

We're going to start out by setting up a quick development environment from scratch, <br>
and then we'll work our way through all of the major ReactiveX topics in an example-based environment. <br>

My goal in this course is to help absolute beginners to gain a solid understanding of the:

- Streams
- Observables & Observers
- Subscriptions
- Subjects
- Operators
